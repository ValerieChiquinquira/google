Google mockup

I have two attempts so far.
- google.html and style.css make up the first version I coded that focused predominately on using flex.
- google2.html and style2.css is the version I'm working on now that uses grid. I have been far more successful in using grid because I was able to make it the page adjust accordingly to window size.
  - I came across certain sites that suggest using @media but I just couldn't grasp it. 
- dummypage.html is just a landing page I included for all the links.
## Things left for me to do
  - make the search bar viable. I think I need to use a form.
  - need to fix the spacing among the header and the footer.
  - need to add the little hover window that pops up over the acct icon and app icon. 
  - fix the styling on the buttons 
    - but I think that also goes along with the form needed with the search bar.
